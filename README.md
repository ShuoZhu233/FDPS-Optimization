Fast Dynamic Partitioning and Sampling (FDPS), which aims to
solve constrained optimization problems in medium and low dimensions for the Robotic Optimization Problem. The algorithm
combines dynamic partitioning, performance-driven sampling allocation, and search space shrinkage strategy to improve the
efficiency and accuracy of global optimization.
